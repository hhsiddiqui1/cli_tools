Dear ANZ Review Team,

Thank you for your letter dated 13 October 2025 and your phone conversation with Mr. Khan on 10 October 2025 regarding our banking arrangements with ANZ.

## Key Points for ANZ's Consideration

### No Cardholder Data Access

- All card data security is Fiserv's responsibility

### Robust Compliance Framework
- Comprehensive KYC verification (driver license, ABN, bank account)
- Automated transaction monitoring with alerts
- Complete digital audit trail
- 7-year record retention
- Regular staff training

### Commitment to Electronic Payments
- Actively reducing cash disbursements
- Providing merchant education and support
- Offering incentives for electronic payment adoption
- Clear timeline to achieve 95%+ electronic payments

### Risk Management
- Merchant base consists of licensed, regulated taxi operators
- Transaction patterns consistent with legitimate taxi operations
